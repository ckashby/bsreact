    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Jennifer (Laura Prepon, Orange is the New Black) is turning 30 and her
      best friend Stan is throwing her a party. But she is in no mood to
      celebrate. She just left her job, as well as her cheating boyfriend, Paul.
      Her cynical little sister Penny is threatening to overshadow the whole
      affair with the most inappropriate party announcement. And she is pretty
      sure she's too old to still be living with her creepy roommate.
